# Analysis of queen establishment

Criterion: did they begin laying worker eggs by Day 30?
- If not by that time we culled them

Data to use: all
- For other variables that relate to colony development over time, we exclude colonies that ever developed EFB
- Since this is a short-term measure, we can include these EFB colonies
- What time frame to look at...

Dates to look at
- Day 30 data is the most key... 
- Simplistically we could just look and see were they QR on day 30 or not?
- But a few colonies had young brood on day 30, so we can't necessarily tell yet if they are drone layers - so let's also look at day 44 data
- It is only ambiguous if they were L3 or lower on day 30
- L3 on day 30 corresponds to anything with a layday of ___ or less
