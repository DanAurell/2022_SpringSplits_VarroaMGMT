# Read in data

```{r}
an_dat <- read.csv("./data_prepared/an_dat.csv")
```


# Dataset of colonies that established and didn't have EFB
```{r}
# Filter out the colonies that had disqualifying issues
# Include the 5 colonies that were pulled out for being weak
 <- an_dat %>% 
  filter(efb + failed + QL + DL == 0)

an_dat$frames_bees[an_dat$weak == 1] <- 0

an_dat$trt
```



## Analyze day 77 Colony strength

```{r}
m.bees <- lm(frames_bees~trt, data = an_dat) # Next run should include a yard level random effect
summary(m.bees)
summary(aov(m.bees))
anova(m.bees) # No effect of treatment (p=0.9999)
plot(m.bees)
```

## Analyze data for colony weight post honey production

```{r}
m.weight <- lm(post_lbs_C~trt, data = an_dat)
summary(m.weight)
```
