# Read in data

```{r}

```

# Prep data for analysis

```{r}
temp <- temp %>%

## Analyze day 77 Colony strength

```{r}
m.bees <- lm(frames_bees~trt_label, data = temp) # Next run should include a yard level random effect
m.bees.2 <- lmer(frames_bees~trt_label + (1 | new_yard), data = temp)
m.bees.3 <- lmer(frames_bees~ 1 + (1 | new_yard), data = temp)
anova(m.bees.2, m.bees.3) # No improvement to include a treatment effect (p=1)

# Still make predictions based on m2, but no statistical detected effect of treatment (p=1)
```

## Analyze data for colony weight post honey production

```{r}
m.weight <- lm(post_lbs_C~trt_label, data = temp)
m.weight.2 <- lmer(post_lbs_C ~ trt_label + (1 | new_yard), data = temp)
m.weight.3 <- lmer(post_lbs_C ~ 1 + (1 | new_yard), data = temp)
anova(m.weight.2, m.weight.3) # No effect of treatment (p=0.77)

# Still graph predictions based on m2 to estimate effect size
```
