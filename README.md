### Structure of GitHub Repository

Each major step in the data analysis workflow for this project is assigned its own folder (see above). Aside from the main script, each folder may also include input data, output data, output images, and supplementary code.

We provide the main script for each major step in Markdown format, which allows us to intersperse chunks of code, comments to explain the code, and output. To quickly inspect the workflow we used, follow the links below.
