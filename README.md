# 2022_SpringSplits_VarroaMGMT
Analysis for an experiment that combined cultural control (queen cells) with chemical control (natural Varroacides) to manage Varroa mites in newly established honey bee colonies.

### Structure of GitHub Repository

Each major step in the data analysis workflow for this project is assigned its own folder (see above). Aside from the main script, each folder may also include input data, output data, output images, and supplementary code.

I provide the main script for each major step in Markdown format, which allows interspersion of chunks of code, comments to explain the code, and output. To quickly inspect the workflow I used, follow the links below.
